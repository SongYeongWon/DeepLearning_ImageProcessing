# LAB: **Facial Temperature Measurement with IR images**

Name : Song Yeong Won

Student number : 21700375

# I. Introduction

In this lab, you are required to create a simple program that detects the temperature of a person wearing a mask. You will be given a video of IR images of several people measuring their face temperature. Measure the maximum and average temperature of the face (excluding the mask) and show a warning sign if the average temperature is above 38.0 C.

We will not use any deep learning or any other complex algorithms. Just use simple image processing methods such as :

* InRange, Morphology, Filtering, findContour

* Refer to [Tutorial: Color Image Segmentation] for programming tips

# II. Procedure

## 2.1 Face Segmentation excluding mask

**Segmentation using InRange()**

Recommendation: use the program code given in [Tutorial:color segemtation]

* Analyze the color space of the raw image. You can use either RGB or HSV space
* Apply necessary pre-processing, such as filtering.
* By using InRange(), segment the area of ROI: exposed skin (face and neck) that are not covered by cloth and mask. You must use inRange of all 3-channels of the color image.
* Apply post-processing such as morphology to enhance the object segmentation.

- Use findContours() to detect all the connected objects
- Select only the proper contour around the face. (Hint: can use the contour area)
- Then, draw the final contour and a box using drawContours( ), boundingRect(), rectangle( )
- Need to show example results of each process.



## 2.2 Temperature Measurement

**Temperature from Intensity data**

The intensity value of the image is the temperature data scaled within the pre-defined temperature range. Use the intensity value to estimate the temperature.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                **Figure 1. IR Camera Image**                 |

- Analyze the intensity values(grayscale, 0-255) of the given image.
- The actual temperature for this lab is ranged from 25(I=0) to 40 C (I=255).
- Estimate the (1) maximum temperature and (2) average tempearture within ONLY the segmented area (Contour Area)
- For average tempeature, use the data within the Top 5% of the tempeature in Descending order.

  - Hint: cv∷sort( ) in SORT_DESCENDING
- Show the result as TEXT on the final output image.

  - Hint: cv∷putText( )
- Your final output should be similar to result of the the Demo_Video.

# III. Image processing

## 3.1 Histogram

The analysis of the original image should be preceded. The histogram of the BGR and HSV for the original was analyzed. The color of the histogram of the BGR histogram represents that for each channel B, G, and R. In the case of the BGR histogram, it can be seen that the effect of G is fine and B and R are dominant. Compared to B, it is thought that the R Channel will be a more effective image for temperature analysis because the distribution of the histogram is spread out widely.

In the case of HSV histogram, RED represents value, Blue represents Hue, and green represents saturate. In the case of Hue, it can be seen that the intensity is concentrated in the center. On the other hand, in the case of Value, it can be seen that the intensity is concentrated in the dark area and the intensity is relatively evenly spread. Among these histograms, an image with the most uniform intensity distribution is used to measure temperature.

| Figure 3. Histogram of BGR and HSV |
| :--------------------------------: |

The **Figure 3** shows the BGR image as an image for each channel. In the case of B,G, most of the intensity occupies a dark area, and the intensity of the temperature bar is irregularly distributed, so it is judged that it is an inappropriate image. In the case of R, it has a relatively uniform intensity distribution compared to B and G, but it is judged to be an inappropriate image use due to the rapidly changing intensity.

| Figure 4. BGR Grayscale of each channel |
| :-------------------------------------: |

The **Figure 4** shows an HSV image as an image for each channel. In the case of Hue, the gray scale value of the pixel is distributed too low, so it is determined that it is difficult to achieve an ideal temperature conversion. In the case of saturate, the saturation of values close to 255 is very high, but the saturation of black pixels close to 0 is low. When using a saturated image, the human skin temperature is also measured at a very high temperature, so it is judged to be an inappropriate image. Finally, in the case of Value, the intensity of temperature bar is normally distributed. Therefore, the value gray scale image was used to calculate the temperature.

## 3.2 Masking

The **Figure 5** shows the masking image as a result of masking the value image and the contour image. We previously converted it to a binary image through InRange and extracted only the max contour area through contour. What we want to know is the surface temperature of the human skin, and the image of the value gray scale image was masked during the HSV image. Only the parts masked through And-gate for the Value gray scale image and masking image maintained the pixel value, and all other parts were made to zero. If only the part contoured with the Value grayscale image is extracted as shown below, it can be confirmed that only the image area we want, such as the masking image, is extracted.

## 3.3 Temperature Calculation

In order to calculate the temperature, the intensity of 0 to 255 must be scaled to 25 to 40 degrees. The formula is as follows. In order to calculate a more accurate measurement value, only the data of the top 5% of the temperature data were used. To that end, the accumulated temperature data were rearranged in descending order, and the number of data corresponding to the top 5% was retrieved and used. The result of the temperature measurement can be confirmed through the attached image below.
$$
Temperature = 25 + intensity \times \frac{15}{255}
$$

# IV. Discussion

* Filtering  validity

  In image processing, an appropriate filter was applied for pre-processing. By applying Median filter, we tried to normalize the imbalance in the pixel of the original value gray scale image. In addition, a filter was used to further improve the intensity distribution of the temperature bar. The difference between before and after the filter is applied is as follows. The left image of **Figure 7** is the image before the filter is applied. Before applying the filter, the Max value and average value were measured to be relatively accurate. The right image of **Figure 7** is the image after applying the filter. In the image after applying the filter, it can be confirmed that the max value and the average value are almost the same. Applying filter makes the intensity distribution of the entire pixel more normal, but as a result, it is difficult to accurately measure the temperature because it serves to simultaneously lower the pixel value at high temperature. Therefore, the value gray scale image for the original image was used as it is without applying the filter.

| Figure 7. Difference filter effect |
| :--------------------------------: |



* Equalization validity

  At first, it was thought that in case of equalization, the temperature distribution of the value gray scale image would change more equally distributed. However, in the original value image, the black part of the background was generally brightened, and the intensity value of the face surface was also increased. Eventually, the average temperature increased further, resulting in incorrect temperature measurements as shown in the figure below.

  | :-------------------------------------: |

  

* Post-processing Validity

  Once the erode is executed, the max-contour area is changed. That is, the skin surface portion of the face does not become the max contour area, and other contour areas that remain without being removed after the erode are determined as maxArea. Therefore, when applying the morphology, as it became difficult to mask the exact image area, the morphology was not performed, and more appropriate HSV min and max values were found and applied.

  

# V. Conclusion

Through this lab, we can learn about color image process. There are several color spaces such as RGB, HSV, YCbCr, and so on. It is important for us to use the appropriate color space to suit our purpose. It should be preceded by analyzing the histogram for the color image to grasp the image characteristics. In addition, a new approach was needed instead of converting the existing image directly to grayscale. Each of the three channels was analyzed as one channel of a gray scale, and the channel image of the desired gray scale was used. In addition, image post-processing may be performed through appropriate morphology before the control is performed as needed.
