# III. Image processing

### 3.1 Histogram

In order to obtain the desired result from image, we have to analyze the original image first. Since the characteristics of each image are different, it is necessary to grasp the shape of the noise and the distribution of the spectrum.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|            **Figure 3. original image histogram**            |

As a result of analyzing the histogram of the original image, it may be confirmed that most of the images pixel values are close to zero, that is, most of the pixels in the dark area. If the original image is used as it is, the distinction between the bolt, the nut, and the background is not clear. Therefore, in order to create a Brightness balanced image, contrast was further expanded through histogram equalization.

### 3.2 equalization

|          **Figure 4. After equalization histogram**          |

**Figure 4** is a equalization histogram in which the original image is wide contrasted through equalization. It can be seen that the pixels of the entire image are widely distributed compared to the original histogram(**Figure 3**). The **Figure 5** is the image of applying Gaussian filter after equalization. In addition, it can be seen that each object is further blurred and the surrounding noise is reduced by the blurring effect.

### 3.3 Filter

Appropriate filter selection is required after equalization. The ultimate purpose of this image processing is to accurately find and count the shapes of bolts and nuts. Therefore, it was thought that it was necessary to remove noise around the object while maintaining the shape of the object as much as possible. So, it was necessary to decide which filter to apply between linear filter and non-linear filter. After applying the linear filter and the non-linear filter, we intend to use a more appropriate filter.

Typical examples of linear filters include box filter and Gaussian filter. I chose the Gaussian filter among them. In the case of box filter, it is useful to remove noise, but as filter size increases, the edge of the object blurs together with noise, so it was considered that it was difficult to clearly distinguish objects. However, in the case of a Gaussian filter, the weight value decreases as it moves away from the center with the largest weight from the center, such as the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, when the Gaussian filter is used, the shape of the object may be maintained well, but noise around the object may be removed.

In addition, among nonlinear filters, media filter was intended to be used. The media filter is effective for impulse noise. In particular, it is useful to remove salt-pepper noise. The media filter has a disadvantage in that the larger the kernel size, the more calculated it is due to sorting, and the processing speed becomes slower. Then, when the thresholding is applied, an appropriate filter will be selected after analyzing the difference between the Gaussian filter and the median filter effect.

### 3.4 Thresholding

First of all, the adaptive threshold was used at first. On the image, the lower left and upper right parts are shown with different brightness by light. Therefore, I thought that using adaptiveThreshold would make a clear distinction regardless of the shadow. However, as a result of actually doing it, even small salt and pepper noise was detected and it was difficult to contour.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|            **Figure 8. Apply adaptive-Threshold**            |

Therefore, a general Global Binary Thresholding was used. The maximum Threshold value that does not break the object was applied through the Trackbar. The **Figure 9** is a binary image with thresholding after applying Gaussian filter. The maximum threshold value capable of object segmentation was applied. The object segmentation worked well, but there are still a lot of salt-pepper noise.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Figure 9. Apply Global Binary Thresholding when using Gaussian filter** |

The **Figure 10** is a binary image with thresholding after applying a median filter. The maximum threshold value capable of object segmentation was applied. It can be seen that salt-pepper noise is significantly reduced compared to the Gaussian filter. Therefore, media filter was selected and used.

### 3.5 Morphology

The Figure 11 is represent the results of the contour for the binary image after thresholding. In the following cases, two Square Nut M5s are attached, so they are considered one object. Therefore, an appropriate morphology was applied to separate the attached Square Nut M5. The figure below is the image after performing opening once. Contour this image will fill all the holes inside the nut.

| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                 **Figure 11. Contour image**                 |

Morphology was applied again after storing the filled image as a new image. By executing erode five times in a row, two attached Square Nut M5 were separated, and dilation was applied four times again to restore it to its original size as much as possible. The best results are as follows**(Figure 12)**.

Colors are displayed differently for each object type. The counting value for each object and the total number of objects are as follows.

# IV. Discussion

* **Filter selection**

  When performing image processing, it is important to select an appropriate filter for the purpose of image processing. Depending on which filter you choose, the results of the same image come out differently. In this lab, we had to focus on non-uniform background light effect, noise, and object segmentation. Theoretically, there was a difference between the expected filter result and the image processing result when actually applied. Therefore, the experiment was conducted by applying several filters to a given image and finding a filter capable of optimal image processing.

* **Thresholding method**

  It was not useful to apply adaptive threshold unconditionally to the non-uniform background light effect. As mentioned earlier in the image processing thresholding part**(3.4)**, it is effective for non-uniform background light effects, but not appropriate for the object segmentation we want. In this case, Global Binary Thresholding was applied, and it was determined that the remaining noise should be removed through morphology post-treatment

* **Morphology method**

  One Hexa Nut M5 disappears if you continue to errode the contour image after initial thresholding. Since the inside and outside of the object are removed together, the shape of the object is not maintained. Therefore, after thresholding, the contoured image was stored as a new image. This image is filled inside the object through the contour filled. If erode method is performed with this image, the only outside part is removed, so two Square Nut M5s could be separated.

  

# V. Conclusion

Through this lab, we were able to learn about the overall image processing process. Only when the image is analyzed can the pre-processing and post-processing processes be performed later. Through the histogram, the intensity distribution and image contrast of the pixel of the image could be confirmed. The selection and application of the threshold technique were considered. Ultimately, it takes a lot of trial and error to process the image we want, and we thought it is most important to find the best way.
